- [Simulation](https://github.com/sagarjauhari/virus_propagation/blob/master/vpm.py#L141) of virus propagation across the network
- Analylsis of different immunization policies
    - [Policy A](https://github.com/sagarjauhari/virus_propagation/blob/master/vpm.py#L31): Select k random nodes for immunization.
    - [Policy B](https://github.com/sagarjauhari/virus_propagation/blob/master/vpm.py#L40): Select the k nodes with highest degree for immunization.
    - [Policy C](https://github.com/sagarjauhari/virus_propagation/blob/master/vpm.py#L49): Select the node with the highest degree for immunization. Remove this node (and its incident edges) from the contact network. Repeat until all vaccines are administered.
    - [Policy D](https://github.com/sagarjauhari/virus_propagation/blob/master/vpm.py#L49): Find the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the contact networkâ€™s adjacency matrix. Find the k largest (absolute) values in the eigenvector. Select the k nodes at the corresponding positions in the eigenvector.

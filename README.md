- Epidemic Threshold: Theoretical analysis of virus propagation based on effective strength [1]
- Simulation of virus propagation across the network
- Analylsis of different immunization policies
    - Policy A: Select k random nodes for immunization.
    - Policy B: Select the k nodes with highest degree for immunization.
    - Policy C: Select the node with the highest degree for immunization. Remove this node (and its incident edges) from the contact network. Repeat until all vaccines are administered.
    - Policy D: Find the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the contact networkâ€™s adjacency matrix. Find the k largest (absolute) values in the eigenvector. Select the k nodes at the corresponding positions in the eigenvector.
